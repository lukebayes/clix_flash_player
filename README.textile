h1. CLIX FlashPlayer

This is a Command Line interface to the Flash Player for OS X.

This project was created because unlike the modern distributions of the desktop debug Flash Player on Windows and Linux, the OS X distribution does not behave properly on OS X at all.

Thanks to the exceedingly poor non-blocking design of the <code>open</code> command on OS X, it is difficult to launch and control an instance of the Flash Player from a terminal application.

h1. The Problem(s)

We need to be able to execute and focus a specific instance of the Flash Player along with a specific SWF file. 

The Flash Player execution thread should block until:

# The Flash Player is Quit using File >> Quit or CMD+Q
# The terminal application is interrupted (SIGHUP) using CTRL+C

The Flash Player should be focused and controlled whether or not a runtime exception occurs in the first frame of the loaded SWF file.

h1. Attempts

h3. <code>open</code> command

The first approach was to use the OS X <code>open</code> command. The problem with open, is that it expects a single application argument, not an application and the file that it should open. When <code>open</code> is sent a second argument, it runs itself twice - leading to two instances of the Flash Player.

h3. <code>exec</code> Flash Player.app/Contents/MacOS/FlashPlayer

This approach is promising in that it is blocking, but suffers because the Flash Player is launched behind all other applications and if a runtime exception is encountered in the loaded SWF, attempts to focus the player lock the process and orphan it when we CTRL+C our parent application.

h3. <code>exec</code> Flash Player.app
